          <p>It was a dark and stormy night...
            All of sudden came a cat in the hat 
            The Cat said, I hate it when my brother Charlie has to go away. My parents constantly try to explain 
            to me how sick he is. That I am lucky for having a brain where all the chemicals flow properly to 
            their destinations like undammed rivers. When I complain about how bored I am without a little brother 
            to play with, they try to make me feel bad by pointing out that his boredom likely far surpasses mine, 
            considering his confine to a dark room in an institution. I always beg for them to give him one last chance. 
            Of course, they did at first. Charlie has been back home several times, each shorter in duration than 
            the last. Every time without fail, it all starts again. The neighbourhood cats with gouged out eyes 
            showing up in his toy chest, my dad's razors found dropped on the baby slide in the park across the 
            street, mom's vitamins replaced by bits of dishwasher tablets. My parents are hesitant now, 
            using "last chances" sparingly. They say his disorder makes him charming, makes it easy for him to 
            fake normalcy, and to trick the doctors who care for him into thinking he is ready for rehabilitation. 
            That I will just have to put up with my boredom if it means staying safe from him. I hate it when 
            Charlie has to go away. It makes me have to pretend to be good until he is back.
